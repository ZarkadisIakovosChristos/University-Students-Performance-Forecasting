# University-Students-Performance-Forecasting
This repository contains information and material for the University Students Performance Forecasting, a project for the course "Statistical Packages II" (UNIPI, Department of Statistics and Insurance Science). The purpose of the project is to make forecasts for the performance index of university students based on various characteristics. The project was written in R. Main tasks where duplicate values detection and removal, statistical analysis (including Density-Histogram-Scatter Plots, QQ-Plots, Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests, like t-test, wilcoxon, ANOVA, Bonferroni, etc., Distribution Fitting Tests with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilks, Anderson Darling, Correlation Analysis with Pearson Spearman, Kendall), outlier detection (with Z-Score, IQR-Score, QD-Score), data splitting, data scaling, feature selection (Forward, Backward and Bidirectional Feature Elimination) and forecasting (with OLS Regression and evaluation with metrics like MSE, MAE, R2, F-Statistic).
